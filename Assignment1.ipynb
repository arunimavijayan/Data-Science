    "integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",

    "\n",
    "Variable is used to store values which can comprise of any datatype like str,int,bool,list,dict,set,tuple etc whereas String is one of the datatype which can be stored into a variable. String values are denoted using \"\" or '', anything enclosed within these quotes will be considered a string.\n",

    "3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many data types in Python for eg:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Numeric Type: (int-->numbers without decimals, float--->numbers with decimals or e, complex---->numbers with real and imaginary part).These are mainly used to store numbers\n",
    "        eg: a=10 ----> a  is of int type\n",
    "            b=14.99 ---> b is of float type\n",
    "            c= 3+ 5j ----->c is of complex type\n",
    "            \n",
    "    Sequence Type:(list--->sequence of mutable values ,tuple----->sequence of immutable value,range--->usually used in for loop to iterate and return a sequence of elements)\n",
    "        e.g: l=[1,2,3,4]---->l is a list\n",
    "             t=(1,2,3,4)-----> t is tuple\n",
    "             k=range(1,8)----> k will return series to numbers starting from 1 till 8 and by default it is incremented by 1\n",
    "             \n",
    "     Mapping Type: dict----->has a key value pair and maps a particular value to a key.\n",
    "         eg: dict1={'a':'hi',b:9}---->dict1 is a dictionary\n",
    "         \n",
    "         \n",
    " 4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    " \n",
    " An expression consists of variables,operators or even method invocations, it follows a particular syntax according to the programming language used. All expressions evaluates to a result, result can be the product of arithmetic calulations, string manipulations or even return from any method etc.\n",
    " \n",
    " 5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    " \n",
    " An expression consists of variables,operators or method invocations which evaluate to a result/value.\n",
    " A statement consists of declaring a variable or displaying some content into the console\n",
    " eg:\n",
    " expression can be 1+9  ----->ths evaluates to a value\n",
    " statement a=1+9 ------->this will strore the result of expression in a variable, this will not display anything unless it is printed\n",

    "bacon = 22\n",

    "Incase i run this in jupyter the value of bacon changes to 23.\n",
    "But if we run it somewhere else we need to print the value of bacon and incase we need to display the incremented value we will either have to write print(bacon+1) or store the updated value of bacon in it like bacon+=1 then print it.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "'spam'+'spamspam'------->'spamspamspam'\n",
    "'spam'* 3  ------------->'spamspamspam'\n",

    "8.Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    " \n",
    " Variable name connot begin with number. It should begin with letter,underscore\n",

    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",

    "'I have eaten' + 99 +'burritos';\n",
    "\n",
    "The above expression gives error because String cannot be concatenated with a int value so to fix this error we need to change the int to str. can be done in two ways put '' around 99 or enclose 99 inside str().\n",
    "'I have eaten' + str(99) +'burritos';\n",
    " or\n",
