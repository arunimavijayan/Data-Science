    "1. What does an empty dictionary's code look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "it is denoted by {}.e.g dict_name={} will create a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the value of a dictionary value with the key 'foo' and the value 42?\n",
    "\n",
    "{'foo':42} the value is 42 and key is 'foo'.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the most significant distinction between a dictionary and a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "List is a ordered sequence of object which is accessed using indices whereas in dictionary the order is not maintained and they are not accessed using indices instead using keys-values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What happens if you try to access spam['foo'] if spam is {'bar': 100}?\n",
    "\n",
    "Will get KeyError\n",

    "5. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.keys()?\n",
    "\n",
    "No difference, it checks if 'cat' exists as a key or not.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.values()?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first expression it checks if 'cat' is present as one of the keys in spam and in second expression it checks if 'cat' is present as values for one of the keys in spam. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is a shortcut for the following code?\n",
    "if 'color' not in spam:\n",
    "spam['color'] = 'black';\n",

    "module can be imported as-> import pprint\n",
