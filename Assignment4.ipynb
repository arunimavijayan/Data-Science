    "\n",
    "12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both are identical because both are sequences, both have positive and negative indexes and the elements can be accessed using index but string is immutable and list is mutable\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are immutable and denoted by(). Lists are mutable and denoted using []\n",

    "14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
    "\n",
    "considering a as name of tuple ,a=(42,)\n",

    "15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert list into tuple use tuple() function and give required list inside the function brackets similarly to convert tuple to list use list() and give the required tuple inside it's function brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "They contain reference to the list values instead of list values unlike string and integer which contains the value in those variables\n",
    "\n",
    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "\n",
    "copy() create reference to original object. If you change copied object then it will affect the original object whereas deepcopy() creates new object and copies original object to new one therefore changing new deepcopied object doesn't affect original object.\n"
